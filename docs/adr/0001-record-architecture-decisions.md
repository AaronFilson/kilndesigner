# 1. Record architecture decisions

- **Status:** accepted
- **Date:** 2026-10-21

## Context

Kilndesigner is both a tool for kiln builders and a portfolio piece. Decisions need to be
explainable later, to a contributor or in an interview, without reconstructing them from commits.

## Decision

Keep lightweight architecture decision records in `docs/adr`, one file per decision, numbered in
order. Each has a status, the context, the decision, its consequences, and a short "In an
interview" note. A decision starts as **proposed** and becomes **accepted** when the first code
built on it is merged. A superseded ADR stays in place, marked as superseded, with a link to its
replacement.

## Consequences

- Writing the ADR is part of making a significant decision, not an afterthought.
- Planning documents (`docs/planning`) say *what* to build; ADRs say *why it's built this way*.
